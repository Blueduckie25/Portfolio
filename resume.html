				<h3>Projects</h3>
				<h5>Machine Learning Health Problem</h5>
				<p>
					I used Weka, a machine learning package, to test various models to predict the mortality outcome in elective hospital patients. I trained the models using a dataset acquired from HCUP to get high performing models that would then be used on a test dataset to see if the performance stayed with positive perameters. 
				</p>

				<h5>Ticketing System</h5>
				<p>
					A system that can be used to input tickets into a database, and view the tickets that were inputted. Furthermore, the system can be used to edit the tickets, and remove the tickets after they have been completed.
				</p>	
				<br>
				
				<h5>Linux Server</h5>
				<p>
					A server that can be accessed by multiple computers at once using Linux. It can be connected to through the use of an ethernet cable, and would be able to host multiple users at once. I needed to create the user accounts, and set their abiliies to perform certain tasks. It was done through the use of a PC that was turned into a server, and a virtual machine to connect a Windows PC to the server.
