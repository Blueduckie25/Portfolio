				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<br>
				<h3>General Info</h3>
				<p>
					My name is Cordell Brettle and I am a computer science major, and currently in my senior year at Capitol Techonlogy University. I am looking to become a programmer and I want to focus on software engineering. I am from a small town in Pennsylvania, but currently am living in Maryland for schooling.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>
					My coding experience began in high school when I first learned to code. I first wanted to learn to code because I wanted to make a game like the ones I grew up playing. My goal of creating a game has since changed, but I fell in love with coding and programming in general. I soon went to Capitol Techonlogy University where I started my degree in Computer Science and I am scheduled to graduate in May 2022. Capitol Techonlogy University has taught me many more skills that have allowed me to become a better programmer.
				</p>
				
				<br>
				<h3> Goals</h3>
				<p>
					My goals are to work in cloud streaming, or machine learning. I want to focus on these areas because they are rising fields that are becoming more important as time goes on. The two fields are slowly become large parts of the world with cloud technology being used by most of the major tech companies.
				</p>
				
				<br>
				<h3>Interests/Hobbies</h3>
				<p>
					My hobbies include gaming, and hikiing. I am an avid gamer, and it is what got me into programming in the first place. Gaming is my main source of entertainment, but I have started watching anime, and have been enjoying that. I like telling stories, and creating my own worlds, and using my imagination to create new things.
